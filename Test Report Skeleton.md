#Executive Summary
The purpose of this automated test was to confirm whether the target web application meets the most basic
security requirements. The test was meant to simulate a malicious attacker exploiting common
vulnerabilities and breaches in a web application. The attacks were conducted under the level of access
and privilege that a general Internet user would have.  

##Summary of Results
*Summary of found vulnerabilities*

#Attack Narrative
##Injection
*Step-by-step description of employed attacks*

##Broken Authentication and Session Management
*Step-by-step description of employed attacks*  

##Cross-Site Scripting
*Step-by-step description of employed attacks*

##Insecure Direct Object References
*Step-by-step description of employed attacks*

##Cross-Site Request Forgery
*Step-by-step description of employed attacks*

#Conclusion
*Brief summary and general risk assignment*

##Recommendations
*Basic recommendations depending on the found vulnerabilities*

##Risk Rating
*Assign a risk rating (low/medium/high) to each found vulnerability*

#Appendix: Methodology
It should be noted that this test was performed in an automated manner using tools such as Arachni or
OWASP ZAP, with no direct human intervention. This makes the test non-exhaustive, and it should be assumed
that the target web application has many more vulnerabilities and security breaches than the ones
mentioned in this report. This test should be taken as a 'lower floor' for possible vulnerabilities. If
this automated test is able to find vulnerabilities in a web application, a resourceful human should be
able to find many more, most of which would escape the scope of this test. If the tested web application
is found to be vulnerable, it is recommended to contact a professional penetration tester to find and
mitigate these and other security breaches.
